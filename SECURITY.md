## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Before reporting, ensure the vulnerability is in Meenu, not one of it's libraries such as LifxLan or Eel.**

**Unsure? Report it here anyway.**

Email me@lukepring.co.uk, including 'Vulnerability Report' in the email subject.

Please detail:
- The version(s) of Meenu the vulnerability is in.
- How to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Symptoms (what could an attacker do with this vulnerability?)
- How you would like to be credited.

I will reply within 12 hours, and aim to get a patch out within 1-2 days, depending on the severity.

You will be credited (if you wish to be) in the patch announcement.
